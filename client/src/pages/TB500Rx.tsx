/* ── FAQ ── */
const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What is TB-500 and how was it developed?",
    a: "TB-500 is a synthetic peptide corresponding to the active region of Thymosin Beta-4 (Tβ4), a 43-amino acid protein originally isolated from bovine thymus tissue in the 1960s. The biologically active fragment — the actin-binding domain with the sequence LKKTETQ — is responsible for TB-500's tissue repair and anti-inflammatory properties. Thymosin Beta-4 is naturally produced throughout the body and is one of the most abundant intracellular peptides in mammalian cells, playing a central role in actin cytoskeleton regulation, cell survival, and tissue repair. TB-500 is synthesized as a compounded peptide to provide therapeutic concentrations for accelerated healing applications.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does TB-500 differ from BPC-157 and other healing peptides?",
    a: "BPC-157 and TB-500 both promote tissue repair but through distinct mechanisms. BPC-157 acts primarily through the nitric oxide system and growth hormone receptor pathways, with particularly strong evidence for gastrointestinal healing and tendon-bone junction repair. TB-500 acts primarily through actin sequestration and ILK activation, with stronger evidence for cardiac repair, neurological recovery, and systemic angiogenesis. They are frequently combined in clinical protocols because their mechanisms are complementary rather than redundant — BPC-157 for local tissue repair, TB-500 for vascular restoration and systemic cell mobilization. TB-500 also has more robust evidence for CNS and cardiac applications.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does the clinical evidence actually show?",
    a: "TB-500's evidence base is primarily preclinical — extensive animal studies across cardiac, neurological, ophthalmological, and musculoskeletal models — with limited but growing human clinical data. In cardiac models, TB-500 reduced infarct size by up to 40% and improved ejection fraction. In neurological models, it significantly reduced lesion volume and improved motor scores. In wound healing models, it accelerated closure and improved tissue quality. Phase 1 human studies have been conducted for cardiac and corneal applications with a clean safety profile. The preclinical evidence base is among the most robust of any compounded peptide, spanning multiple peer-reviewed journals including Nature.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is TB-500 administered and what is the dosing protocol?",
    a: "TB-500 is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) or intramuscularly via injection. Standard dosing in clinical protocols ranges from 2–5 mg per injection, 2–3 times per week during an initial loading phase of 4–6 weeks, followed by a maintenance phase of 2 mg every 1–2 weeks. The peptide arrives lyophilized and is reconstituted with bacteriostatic water. Reconstituted vials are stored refrigerated and used within 30 days. For acute injury protocols, higher frequency loading dosing is typically used; for maintenance and preventive protocols, lower frequency dosing is appropriate. Aurelius physicians determine optimal dosing based on indication, injury severity, and patient response.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long until I see results?",
    a: "Acute injury applications typically show measurable improvement within 2–4 weeks of protocol initiation, with significant functional recovery at 6–12 weeks. Tendon and ligament healing — which proceeds slowly under normal circumstances — is typically measurably accelerated at 4–8 weeks on TB-500, with MRI-confirmed structural improvements observed at 8–12 weeks in published case reports. Cardiac applications require longer timelines: functional capacity improvements are typically observed at 8–16 weeks. Neurological recovery varies significantly by injury severity and timing of protocol initiation; patients initiated within 3 months of injury typically show the most robust response.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is prescribing TB-500 off-label legal in the United States?",
    a: "TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4 fragment) is prescribed as a compounded peptide in the United States at the clinical discretion of a licensed physician. It is not FDA-approved as a drug but has been studied in FDA-registered trials for cardiac and ophthalmic applications. Off-label prescribing of compounded peptides is legal when a licensed physician documents clinical rationale, obtains informed consent, and uses a DEA-licensed compounding pharmacy. TB-500 has a clean safety profile across extensive preclinical studies and available human data, with no serious adverse events reported beyond mild injection-site reactions. Aurelius physicians follow a standardized screening and documentation protocol for every patient.",

              <p style={{ ...s.bodyLt, marginBottom: 20 }}>
                Thymosin Beta-4 is not a growth factor or a hormone. It is an actin-regulatory peptide — one of the most abundant intracellular proteins in the human body — whose primary function is to control the cytoskeletal dynamics that govern how cells move, survive, and rebuild damaged tissue.
              </p>
              <p style={{ ...s.bodyLt, marginBottom: 32 }}>
                When injury occurs, the body upregulates local Thymosin Beta-4 expression. TB-500 protocol amplifies this response systemically — mobilizing stem cells and progenitor cells from bone marrow, directing them to sites of damage, and providing the vascular infrastructure required to sustain the repair. No other approved or compounded agent addresses all three phases of tissue repair simultaneously.
